### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience building high availability and scalability systems.

I consider myself an enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science techniques and technologies. Recently I finished the Bootcamps "Machine Learning" and "Data Scientist" at IGTI (Institute of Management and Information Technology) and I am currently taking the specialization course "Data Science and Big Data" at PUC-MG (Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais).

I currently use JAVA, SCALA, C # DOTNET CORE and PYTHON platforms for the engineering and construction of high availability and scalability solutions (micro services, batch processing, Web applications, chatbots). Always aiming at high rates of assertiveness I use techniques such as Test Driven Development (TDD) and the application of Design Patterns. I use the Sonar tool to monitor solution's code quality metrics.

As a software configuration manager I maintain the version control and changes in solutions, auditing their configurations in the various environments in which they are available, planning and maintaining the continuous integration (CI / CD) of the solutions. I have mastery of the Git and GitHub version control systems and use the Jenkins and GitLab-CI tools to configure the continuous integration of projects.

To achieve high levels of efficiency in performance, availability and resource utilization of the solutions I use Big Data technologies such as ElasticSearch, Apache Solr, Apache Hadoop tools such as HBase, Hive, Kudo, Spark, among others, Docker container software and services availability of cloud and public solutions such as Google Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Run, Aws RDS and Aws EC2, and as software monitoring technologies Grafana and Prometheus.
